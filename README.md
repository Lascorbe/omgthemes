The site scans the fork tree of this repository for Xcode themes contributions.

So, fork to add new themes.

Currently the site regenerates every five minutes.

The site works by converting themes to CSS (for display at the site).

We will recursively look for themes, this is useful in case you already have a repository that contains themes. You can fork this repository and then force push your existing repositoryâ€™s git history to your fork. After you can then delete your existing repository and rename your fork of this repository to what your existing repostitory is called so in effect nothing has changed bar linking your repo to this one so our site can find it.

TODO
====
* Convert both ways so we can auto-convert to other theme types.
* Follow fork chains for forks and show what variations people have provided.
* Ratings, repo stars aren't enough as repos can contain multiple themes
